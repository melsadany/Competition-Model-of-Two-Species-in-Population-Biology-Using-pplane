# Competition-Model-of-Two-Species-in-Population-Biology-Using-pplane

This project is to simulate the behavior of 2 species living in the same environment and compete on the same food source. By running this simulation, you can get the equilibria points for the biological system and determine the competition model type whether it is a coexistence model or a survival-extinction model.
