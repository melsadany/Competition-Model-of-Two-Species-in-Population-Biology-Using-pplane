# Competition-Model-of-Two-Species-in-Population-Biology-Using-pplane

This project is to simulate the behavior of 2 species living at the same enviroment and compete on the same food sourse. By running this simulation, you can get the equilibria points for the biological system and determine the compeition model type whether it is a coexistance model or a survival-extinction model.
